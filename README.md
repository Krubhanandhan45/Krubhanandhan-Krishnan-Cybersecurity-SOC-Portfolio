Krubhanandhan Krishnan — Cybersecurity SOC Portfolio

SOC Analyst | Blue Team | Detection Engineering | Threat Analysis | Security Monitoring

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio!
This repository showcases my hands-on SOC labs, MITRE ATT&CK adversary simulations, threat detection engineering, SIEM investigations, and blue-team security analysis work.
All projects are designed to demonstrate practical, real-world SOC analyst skills.

About Me

Master’s student in Telecommunications & Networks (M2) — CNAM Paris, specializing in:

SOC Monitoring & SIEM (Splunk, QRadar)

MITRE ATT&CK–based detection

Threat analysis & incident response

Adversary simulation

Detection engineering

Log analysis & security automation

Actively seeking a Cybersecurity / SOC Analyst Internship (Stage) — March 2026.

ortfolio Structure

This portfolio contains:

SOC Detection Engineering Labs

MITRE ATT&CK Hands-On Labs

Threat Investigation & Log Analysis Workflows

Splunk Use Cases & Detection Rules

Scripts, Queries, and Security Automation Tools

1. SOC Detection Engineering Projects (Splunk)
🔸 SOC Detection – Brute Force, Password Spray, MFA Fatigue

Techniques:
✔ MFA Push Fatigue (T1621)
✔ Brute Force / Password Spray (T1110.001 / T1110.003)
✔ Authentication abuse detection

What I built:

Custom Splunk detections for MFA fatigue + spray attacks

Normalized logs & created dashboards to visualize attacks

Detection rule triggers + triage notes

Investigation workflow for compromised user account behavior

2. MITRE ATT&CK Hands-On SOC Labs
🔸 Lab 1 — T1059 Command Execution

Simulated attacker command execution in logs

Detected suspicious execution patterns & indicators

Built detection logic + hypothesis documentation

🔸 Lab 2 — T1059.004 Bash Execution

Identified unexpected shell commands

Analyzed abnormal process behavior

🔸 Lab 3 — T1003 Credential Dumping

Investigated logs for credential access techniques

Mapped events to ATT&CK framework

🔸 Lab 4 — T1566 Phishing (Yodobashi Email)

Performed phishing email analysis

Extracted indicators (senders, URLs, payloads)

Documented SOC investigation workflow

🔗 GitHub Repository:
https://github.com/Krubhanandhan45/soc-mitre-labs

SIEM Investigations & Detection Rules
Includes:

Splunk search queries for brute force, phishing, credential access

Custom dashboards for user behavior analytics

Normalized event schema for SOC use cases

Detection logic with mapping to MITRE ATT&CK
